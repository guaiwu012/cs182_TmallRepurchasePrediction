Tmall Repurchase Prediction
Final project for cs182, 24 fall, ShanghaiTech

Environment
It is recommended using conda to create an isolated Python environment, and install the required dependencies via the 'requirements.txt' file.

Suggest to use python=3.9.x
The code may not work correctly or be very slow on other version.

# Create and activate conda env  
conda create -n your_env_name python=3.9  
conda activate your_env_name  
# Install the dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Note: The environment may not work correctly for GPU on your computer. You could fix it by yourself.
